This repository contains a Dockerfile with an uncommon error that leads to build inconsistencies.  The original Dockerfile uses the outdated `ubuntu:latest` image and doesn't explicitly define the entrypoint. This can result in unpredictable behavior and difficulty in reproducing builds across different environments. The corrected version provides a more robust and consistent build process.
